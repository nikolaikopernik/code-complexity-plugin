explanationText=<html>\
Language constructions which increase the complexity add +1 to the complexity score. <br>\
Nesting increases this rate proportionally to the nesting level. <br>\
The sum of all the scores for a method determines it's complexity. <br>\
By default, method is highlighted as simple if it's complexity is less then 8 (and <br>\
very complex if it's more than 12) but using this form you can adjust these limits. <br>\
<br>\
For classes the complexity limits are calculated as `4 * method complexity limits`.\
